    <h1>German Pilsner</h1>
    <img src="../images/pils.jpg">
    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>This recipe from Josh Weikert, author of the Beer: Simple blog is for a 
        bare-bones, but crisp and flavorful, German Pils.
    The grist is simplicity itself, all Pils with just a touch of Victory to 
    bring out a rich grainy malt flavor, and it has plenty 
    of IBUs and hops flavor to keep it firmly in the Pilsner family. He says 
    that the key is fermentation: use any and all tricks in 
    your arsenal to dry this one out, with effective temperature control during 
    fermentation being key.</p>
    <h3>All-Grain<h3>
        <li>Brewhouse efficiency: 72%</li>
        <li><strong>Original Gravity:</strong>1.049</li>
        <li><strong>Final Gravity:</strong>1.010</li>
        <li><strong>IBU:</strong>41</li>
        <li><strong>ABV:</strong>4.9%</li></ul>   
    <h3>Malt/Grain Bill</h3>
    <ul><li>9lb(4.8kg) German Pilsner malt</li>
        <li>.25lb(113g) Victory Malt</li></ul>
    <h3>Hops Schedule</h3>
        <ul><li>0.5oz(14g) Warrior at 60 minutes</li>
            <li>0.5oz(14g) Hallertau at 10 minutes</li>
            <li>0.5oz(14g) Hallertau at flame out</li></ul>
    <h3>Yeast</h3>
    Wyeast 2124 Bohemian Lager
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <p>Mill the grains and mix them with 3.2 gallons 
        (12.1 liters) of 164°F (73°C) strike water to reach 
        a mash temperature of 152°F (67°C). Hold this temperature 
        for 60 minutes; if your water is soft to slightly hard, y
        ou may consider adding 1/4 teaspoon of gypsum to the mash.</p>
    
    <p>Vorlauf until your runnings are clear. Sparge the grains with 3.8 gallons (14.4 liters) 
        and top up as necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 liters) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, 
        following the hops schedule and adding Irish Moss as desired.</p>

    <p>After the boil, chill the wort, aerate, and pitch the yeast.</p>

    <p>Ferment at 50°F (10°C) until final gravity is reached; increase the temperature 
        by a few degrees at the latter stages of fermentation to aid in diacetyl cleanup. 
        Once the beer completes fermentation, but before packaging, you may want to cold crash 
        it to 35°F (2°C) for 48 hours to improve clarity. Bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to
         approximately 2.5 volumes. Store carbonated beer at near-freezing temperatures for at least 4 weeks before drinking.
