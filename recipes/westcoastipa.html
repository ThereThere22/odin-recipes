    <h1>West Coast IPA</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>West Coast IPAs are traditionally known for their bold hop aroma, 
        high bitterness, and citrus and piney notes and flavors. They’re 
        typically brewed with higher amounts of hops in the boil kettle, which 
        leads to the high bitterness, and a mid-palate hop flavor. Hops are still 
        added to the beer after fermentation to provide more aroma and little bitterness, 
        but the proportions are more equal between the two. </p>

        <h3>Yeast</h3>
        Fermentis Safale US-05 American Ale Yeast
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <p>Mash the grains at 152°F (67°C) for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings 
            are clear, then run off into the kettle. Sparge the grains and top up as 
            necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 l) of wort—or more, depending on your 
            evaporation rate. Boil for 90 minutes following the hops schedule.</p>

            <p>After the boil, chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, 
            about 64°F (18°C). Aerate the wort and pitch the yeast.</p>
            
            <p>Ferment at 68°F (20°C) until fermentation is complete. If possible, chill 
            the finished beer to 59°F (15°C) to flocculate the yeast. Remove the yeast 
            or transfer to a secondary vessel purged with CO2. Add the dry hops and hold
             at 59°F (15°C) for 3 days. Chill to 34°F (1°C) and condition for one week.</p>
