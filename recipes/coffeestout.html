    <h1>Coffee Stout</h1>
    <img src="../images/coffeestout.jpg"width="400">
    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Stouts tend to have aromas of ground coffee and dark fruits 
        (typically plum, prune, or black currant), with hints of spice, wood, or earth. 
        They typically have flavors of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, toast, caramel, 
        and sometimes a light nuttiness or char. The chocolate taste comes from kilning 
        the malt at high temperatures (sometimes cocoa is added during the brewing process 
        for additional chocolate flavor). All stouts have a very thick body, which is why they 
        are sometimes nicknamed “meal in a bottle.” Overall, stouts are full, creamy, smooth, 
        rich and satisfying.</p>

        <h3>Yeast</h3>
        Wyeast 1318 (London Ale III) Yeast
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <p>Mill the grains and mix with 3.1 gallons (11.8 l) of 163°F (73°C) strike water to reach a mash 
        temperature of 152°F (67°C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear, 
        then run off into the kettle. Sparge the grains with 4.1 gallons (15.6 l) and top up as necessary to obtain
         6 gallons (23 l) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, following the hops schedule.</p>

        <p>After the boil, chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 65°F (17°C). Aerate the wort with pure 
        oxygen or filtered air and pitch yeast.</p>

        <p>Ferment at 66°F (17°C) for 14 days. Allow the temperature to free-rise while making your cold-brew coffee addition: place 
        round coffee (minus 2–3 oz/57–85 g) in a sealable container and cover with water, steeping for 2–3 days. At the same time, 
        put the remaining ground coffee in a muslin bag and steep in the beer. Remove the steeped grounds from the beer, then strain
        the cold-brew and add to taste into the finished beer. Cold crash, then bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to 2.25 volumes of CO2.</p>
        <h3>Additional Tips:</h3>
        <p>Select a coffee that you like, but if you’re unsure, I recommend something with rich cocoa notes rather than the fruitier coffees.
        Experiment, though! What matters more than the coffee you select is the quality of the product: visit a good local roaster and trust the product.</p>
